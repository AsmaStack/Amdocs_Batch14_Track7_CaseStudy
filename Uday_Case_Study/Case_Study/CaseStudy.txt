# For using MySQL we need to change the dependencies int pom.xml file and the dialect in application.properties

# For @PutMapping the format in json needs to be:

{
	"order_id":4,
	"order_date":"21-08-2023",
	"order_status":"Shipped",
	"customer": {
		"customer_id":4
	}
}

# For @PostMapping the format in json can be:

{
	"order_date":"21-08-2023",
	"order_status":"Shipped",
	"customer": {
		"customer_id":4
	}
}

	--> If the order number is already present in the database the result will return null.
	--> Since the order number is getting auto incremented we don't need to mention it
